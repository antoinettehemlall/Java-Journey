# Java-Journey
The goal of this project is to document the learning process for the programming language Java. Although the programs here are very simple, they demonstrate learning by doing. The long-term goal is to be able to write more complex and perhaps useful programs.

## Description
[Java Part 1](https://github.com/antoinettehemlall/Java-Journey/tree/master/Java%20Part%201) contains parts of code taught from the course [**LinkedIn Learning: Learning Java**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-java-4?trk=search-result_learning_card_title&upsellOrderOrigin=default_guest_learning). The code contained here was used to practice introductory concepts in Java. [IntelliJ IDEA]( https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) was used to compile the programs.
